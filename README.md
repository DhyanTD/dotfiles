# dotfiles
This is my set of linux dotfiles I use on my hyprland fedora setup

A Big Thanks to stow for making it so easy to maintain dotfiles : https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/

For someone like me who likes to play around with linux config and keeps on spicying things up, "STOW" is a bless.

Previously, I Used to maintain idividual repo for all the dotfiles...

Habibi, Now I switched to Stow 😎!

Feel free to fork my dotfiles...🤝
