# dotfiles
This is my set of linux dotfiles I use on my hyprland fedora setup

A Big Thanks to stow for making it so easy to maintain dotfiles : https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/

For someone like me who likes to play around with linux config and keeps on spicying things up, "STOW" is a bless.

Previously, I Used to maintain individual repo for each of my dotfiles...

Habibi, Now I switched to Stow😎!


Feel free to fork my dotfiles...🤝
